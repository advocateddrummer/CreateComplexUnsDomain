CreateComplexUnsDomain
======================

This Pointwise Glyph script facilitates the easy creation of an unstructured
domain that has multiple (interpretation: way more that you want to pick
manually) inner edges.


Usage
-----

Upon execution this script simply prompt the user to first select the
connectors to be used for the outer edge of the unstructured domain. Once these
are selected, the user is prompted to select all the connectors that make up
the inner edges. This script supports the inclusion of baffles as members of
the inner edges.


Note: the script disables selection of any connectors that were previously
selected for the outer edge of the domain to make selection of the inner edges
easier.


Also note: This script potentially generates many warnings, this could cause
the message window to be flooded with warnings if the user has enabled warnings
in the text output.


Options
-------

There are currently only two options/parameters that can be tweaked. These
options can be modified by changing their default values at the top of the
script.

* `verbose`: if this is set to one (1) the script will print more information to
  the message window.

* `initializeDomain`: if this is set to one (1) the complex domain will be
  initialized by the script after it is created.
